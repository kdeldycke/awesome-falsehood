A curated [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list of falsehoods programmers believe in. A *falsehood* is an ***idea* that you initially believed was true**, but in reality, it is **proven to be false**.

E.g. of an *idea*: valid email address exactly has one `@` character. So, you will use this rule to implement your email-field validation logic. Right? Wrong! The *reality* is: emails can have multiple `@` chars. Therefore your implementation should allow this. The initial *idea* is a falsehood you believed in.

The *falsehood* articles listed below will have a comprehensive list of those false-beliefs that you should be aware of, to help you become a better programmer.
