## Motivation

TODO: explain why this list is aweseome.

You want to solve all problem of the world? Not so fast. There's a huge
dicrepency between the world you picture in your head and the reality. The
world is much more complicated, full of edge cases and inconsitencies.

Because of war, love, law,

dispelled myth

and/or expose how a a business domain or a particular familiar concept is much
more intricate and complex than expected.

When possible, we provide a list of libraries or module that may solve, or try
to, the complexities and idiosyncracies of the pointed domain.
