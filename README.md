## Foreword

*Falsehood* articles are a form of commentary on a particular subject, and are
appreciated by the developer community at large for their effectiveness and
terseness. They're a convenient written form to approach an unfamiliar domain
by dispelling myths, point out common pitfalls, show inconsistencies and
subtleties.

In a sense, *Falsehood* articles are a suite of wordy unit-tests covering
extensive edge-cases provided by real-world usage.

guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.


## Good Candidates

Here is a non-restrictive list of items which are good candidates for inclusion
in this awesome list.

### *Falsehood* Articles

Articles following the *falsehood* scheme are prime candidates for inclusion in
this awesome list.

These articles starts with the hypothesis that developers have a naive, simple
view of the subject at hand. Then proceed to list a set of candid assumptions
that might be held by such programmers. Each one is intentionally false, and
sometimes illustrated by a counter-example.

A list of falsehood is crafted as a progression that is designed to refine
concepts. Having read the whole list of falsehood, the reader should possess a
global, if not complete, overview of the domain being targeted by the article,
including most, if not all, its pitfalls, edges-cases and inconsistencies.

In the worst case, these articles might provoke an emotional reaction and cause
flipping table. `(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻`

### Libraries

When possible, we provide a list of programming libraries or modules that may
solve, or try to, the complexities and idiosyncrasies pointed by the
*falsehood* articles above.

So we can put back tables in place. `┬─┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)`

### Data Structures

Data models and structures generic enough to cover and address most of the
falsehoods are also welcome in this page.
